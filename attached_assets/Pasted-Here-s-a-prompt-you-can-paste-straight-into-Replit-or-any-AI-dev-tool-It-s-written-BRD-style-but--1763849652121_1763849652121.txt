PROJECT TITLE:
NYC Kindergarten School Finder – Parent-Friendly Dashboard

⸻

CONTEXT & GOAL

I am a parent of a 4-year-old applying to NYC kindergarten. I need a simple, parent-friendly web dashboard that helps me browse and compare NYC public/charter elementary schools by district and school name, using publicly available school data (test scores, climate, etc.).

For this first version, it’s OK to use static sample data (JSON) that mimics real NYC DOE / NYSED data. Focus on a clean UX and clear structure so actual APIs can be wired in later.

⸻

HIGH-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

Build a single-page web application (SPA) with:
	1.	Landing / Main Dashboard (one page)
	•	A top filter bar with:
	•	Text search: Search by school name (case-insensitive, live filtering).
	•	Dropdown: Select NYC District (e.g., “All Districts, 1, 2, 3, …”).
	•	Optional dropdown: Grade band (e.g., “K–5, K–8, All”).
	•	A sortable, scrollable school list:
	•	Each row/card shows:
	•	School name
	•	DBN (school code)
	•	District
	•	Overall score (0–100, see below)
	•	ELA % proficient, Math % proficient
	•	Student–teacher ratio (if available)
	•	Click on a school row/card to open a detail panel.
	•	A simple scoring model (computed on the frontend for now):
	•	overallScore = 0.4 * academics + 0.3 * climate + 0.3 * progress
	•	Each factor is a 0–100 value from the dataset.
	•	Sorting controls:
	•	Sort by: Overall Score (default), Academics, Climate, Progress, School Name A–Z.
	2.	School Detail Panel / Drawer
When a school is clicked, show a side panel or modal (no separate page) with:
	•	Header:
	•	School name, DBN, district
	•	Address (if available in data)
	•	“Snapshot” section:
	•	Overall score (0–100) with label (“Outstanding / Strong / Average / Below average” based on ranges)
	•	A small radar or bar chart showing:
	•	Academics score
	•	Climate score
	•	Progress score
	•	“Academics” section:
	•	ELA % proficient
	•	Math % proficient
	•	“Environment / Climate” section:
	•	Climate score and 2–3 submetrics if present (e.g., safety, family engagement).
	•	“Details” section:
	•	Enrollment, grade span, student–teacher ratio (if available).
	3.	Filters & UX Behavior
	•	Filters and search should work together:
	•	District filter + name search + sort should all combine.
	•	No page reloads; everything should update client-side.
	•	If no schools match the filters, show a friendly “No schools found for these filters” message.

DATA MODEL (SAMPLE JSON)

Create a local JSON file (e.g., schools.json) with at least ~20 sample entries so the UI feels real. Each school object should look like:

{
  "dbn": "02M123",
  "name": "PS 123 Example Elementary",
  "district": 2,
  "address": "123 Example St, New York, NY 10028",
  "grade_band": "K-5",
  "academics_score": 78,
  "climate_score": 85,
  "progress_score": 72,
  "ela_proficiency": 65,
  "math_proficiency": 70,
  "enrollment": 550,
  "student_teacher_ratio": 15.2
}

The frontend should:
	•	Load this JSON on startup.
	•	Compute overallScore from the 3 scores.
	•	Display everything without needing any external API.

⸻

UX & DESIGN GUIDELINES
	•	Clean, modern, parent-friendly look.
Think: large fonts, lots of whitespace, clear labels, minimal clutter.
	•	Use responsive design so it works on desktop and tablet.
	•	Visual elements:
	•	Use a simple chart for the detail view (e.g., minimal radar or grouped bar chart).
	•	Use subtle card styling for each school in the list.
	•	Make it obvious that:
	•	You can click a school to view more details.
	•	Filters are at the top and affect the list immediately.

⸻

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
	•	Use React + TypeScript for the frontend.
	•	Use a simple build setup (Vite or Create React App equivalent in Replit).
	•	Organize code into components, for example:
	•	App – main layout and state management
	•	FilterBar – search + district + grade band controls
	•	SchoolList – displays the table or cards
	•	SchoolCard – individual school row/card
	•	SchoolDetailPanel – side drawer/modal with detailed info
	•	State management can be local React state (no need for Redux).
	•	No backend required for this version; just load the local JSON.
	•	Write clear comments in the code to show where real NYC data integrations (DOE/NYSED APIs or CSV imports) could be plugged in later.

⸻

OUT OF SCOPE (FOR THIS VERSION)
	•	User login / accounts.
	•	Saving favorites or comparisons.
	•	Real API integration with NYC DOE / NYSED.
	•	Maps or commute calculations.

⸻

DELIVERABLE

A working React + TypeScript app in Replit that:
	1.	Loads schools.json with sample NYC-like school data.
	2.	Lets me:
	•	Filter by district
	•	Search by school name
	•	Sort by different scores
	3.	Shows a nice, intuitive dashboard of schools for a NYC parent choosing kindergarten.
	4.	Has a clickable detail panel with charts and key metrics for each school.

⸻

Please generate all code files, set up the project so it runs in Replit with a single “Run” command, and include a brief README explaining how to:
	•	Run the app
	•	Where to edit schools.json
	•	Where to later connect to real NYC school data APIs.
